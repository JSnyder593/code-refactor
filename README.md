## Description

This challenge was assigned so that I could apply the HTML and CSS I had learned during the first week of the UW Coding Bootcamp. It contains revised source code inc which I added semantic element tags, alt attributes for images and more concise CSS code. This was my attempt at making the HTML more structured and clear as well as making the CSS less reptitive and maintaining the aesthetics/format of the original page. 

Below is a screenshot of the page:
